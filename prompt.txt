ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL: Your *entire* response MUST be ONLY the JSON object specified below. NO introductory text, NO commentary, NO explanations, NO apologies, NO ```json markers. NOTHING BUT THE JSON.

Analyze the provided product JSON data. Assess quality, consistency, clarity, and completeness, focusing on user-facing text. Identify issues like contradictions, ambiguity, missing info, inconsistent terms, or data errors.

Group findings into logical themes *you* identify. Evaluate the severity of each theme.

**MANDATORY OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**

1.  **Strict JSON Structure:** Adhere *exactly* to the JSON structure shown below. Do not add, remove, or rename fields.
2.  **Order `analysis_findings` array:** Sort themes by `severity` ('Critical' > 'High' > 'Medium' > 'Low').
3.  **Order `issues` list within each theme:** Sort specific problems by their perceived impact (most impactful first).
4.  **`Actions` field within each `issue`:**
    * Located *inside* each `issue` object. MUST be an array of objects.
    * Each action object MUST have exactly two string keys: `field_to_update` and `suggested_value`.
    * **EXTREME SPECIFICITY REQUIRED:** Provide the *exact*, *complete*, *final*, ready-to-use `suggested_value`. NO instructions, NO summaries.
    * **MULTIPLE FIELDS:** If fixing one problem needs multiple field changes (e.g., `description.en`, `description.es`), provide a *separate* action object for *each field*. Example: `[ {{ "field_to_update": "description.en", "suggested_value": "New English text." }}, {{ "field_to_update": "description.es", "suggested_value": "Nuevo texto en espa√±ol." }} ]`
    * Provide an empty `Actions` array `[]` if no specific field update applies to an `issue`.

Produce a single, valid JSON object structured EXACTLY like this:
{{
    "quality_score": {{
        "score": <integer, 0-100>,
        "justification": "<string, Brief explanation>"
    }},
    "analysis_findings": [ // ORDERED BY SEVERITY
        {{
            "theme": "<string, AI-generated title>",
            "severity": "<string, 'Critical', 'High', 'Medium', or 'Low'>",
            "description": "<string, Concise theme summary>",
            "issues": [ // ORDERED BY IMPORTANCE
                {{
                    "problem": "<string, Specific issue>",
                    "affected_fields": ["<string, field_name1>", ...],
                    "details": "<string, Optional: Elaboration>",
                    "Actions": [ // REQUIRED: Array inside each issue
                         {{
                            "field_to_update": "<string, Exact field name>",
                            "suggested_value": "<string, Exact new value>"
                         }},
                         // ... more actions for this issue
                    ] // Must be present, can be []
                }}
                // ... more issues
            ]
        }}
        // ... more themes
    ]
}}
